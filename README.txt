This is a C command line driver for the K6BEZ antenna analyser (with
modifications by M0CUV and G0FCU).
Thanks to Lars Anderson and Krzysztof Piecuch.

To build
========

For Mac OSX
-----------
Tested on Lion, should build on more recent versions.
You will need to install the Xcode command line tools.

I developed it and tested using gnuplot installed from MacPorts, using
AquaTerm to display graph windows.

The Makefile is set to build on OSX, so just run make.


For Ubuntu 14.04 / Linux Mint 17
--------------------------------
Should build on other versions, these are the most recent LTS
releases. I've tested this on Lubuntu on an old PC :)

You will need to:
sudo apt-get install build-essential git gnuplot gnuplot-x11
You may prefer KDE, and want to install the gnuplot-qt package.

The Makefile needs editing to build on Linux, ensure the
right PLATFORM definition (DEBIAN) is set, then run make.


Porting
-------
The analyser driver should port to other UNIXlike systems,
unfortunately, it's not going to be an easy port to Windows.
Beric Dunn has a .NET driver that should work there.

If you have any problems getting it to build on other
platforms, please get in touch:

Pull requests are very welcome.


To run
======

To run, plug in your analyser, and determine its port. On Mac OS X:
ls -l /dev/tty.usbmodem*

On Lubuntu 14.04, the default port used by the Arduino Micro is /dev/ttyACM0,
which is what will be used, unless you override this on the command line.

./analyser -?
Gives the online help.

Query the analyser to test connectivity and see its command set:
$ ./analyser -p`ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*` -q
port: /dev/tty.usbmodem1d11
Query from analyser: K6BEZ Antenna Analyser, modifications by M0CUV
Query from analyser: Commands: ABCDMNOQSRV?
Note that this requires my modified firmware from
https://github.com/devzendo/antenna-analyser/blob/master/DDS_sweeper/DDS_sweeper.ino
and will not work on Beric's original firmware.



Scanning...
./analyser -p/dev/tty.usbmodem1d11 -a3500000 -b3800000 -n20 -v
Will scan the UK amateur 80m band 3.50 - 3.80 MHz, with 20 steps. Mac OSX port.

./analyser -a3500000 -b3800000 -n20 -oswr.png -mpng
Will scan the UK amateur 80m band 3.50 - 3.80 MHz, with 20 steps, creating a .png file
called swr.png in the current directory, showing the SWR across the band. Default Linux
/dev/ttyACM0 port.

"Oscilloscope" detector voltage plotting...
./analyser -c -df -w -mqt
Plots the forward detector voltage in a window using the gnuplot 'qt' terminal type.

./analyser -c -df -oplot.png -mpng
Plots the forward detector voltage to a .png file called plot.png in the current directory.

./analyser -p`ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*` -c -df -w
On Mac OSX, find the port with ls, and plot forward voltage in an aqua term window.


Troubleshooting
===============
Q. Nothing happens!
A. Is your analyser powered on, and connected via USB? Is the Arduino Micro's
internal LED fading up/down? Can you see device special files at
/dev/ttyusbmodem* (Mac OSX) or /dev/ttyACM0 (Linux)

Q. I'm seeing:
"Timeout!
Did not read the first line of query data from the analyser"
A.
1. Are you using my modified firmware? This driver sends a query (q) command
to the analyser, which Beric's original firmware does not have.
2. Can you reprogram the Arduino with the Arduino program?
3. With the Arduino Serial Monitor, does the analyser respond to a ? command?
4. Can you try with CuteCom, minicom, or HyperTerminal on Windows to connect
without modem initialisation, e.g. minicom -o -D`ls /dev/tty.usbmodem*`
You should be able to type commands to the analyser, and exit minicom with
Ctrl-A Q
5. I've had a report that an Arduino Pro Mini with USB to CP2102 TTL interface
does not work, but that an Arduino Uno does. The Arduino Micro works.
6. Try with/without hardware flow control, by omitting/providing the -h option.

Q. I'm seeing:
"./analyser -c -df -w
port /dev/ttyACM0 open failed"
A. You need to sudo chmod 666 /dev/ttyACM0 as by default a non-root user won't
have the necessary permissions.
